# Reinforcement learning

A great area of machine learning is Reinforcement learning and it consists of algorithms. For example, those can be used to teach a robot dog how to walk.

Every RL algorithm is working on the principle of giving some kind of reward to the algorithm and it learns the good behavior in that way.

* For now, you can find only two algorithms **Upper Confidence Bound** and **Thompson sampling**.
